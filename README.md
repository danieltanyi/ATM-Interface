# ATM-Interface
# About
In this project you will build an ATM interface. It will emulate the basic functionality of an actual ATM. To use the system users need to be authenticated before being allowed into the system. The credentials consist of a password and a unique username. After entering the correct credentials, users can see their bank details like account balance and perform actions such as transfer, withdraw, deposit and quit.
